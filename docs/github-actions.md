# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform. CI/CD is a way of automating tasks that build and deploy your app so that they run whenever your code updates.

This website uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages whenever there's an update on the `main` branch.
